# GPU-CPU Memory Transfer

## About the project
CPU and GPU are two separate processors; each has its memory. There are several ways in
which data are transferred between processors, as follows:
- Unified memory introduced in CUDA 6
- Prefetching of data with memory advice
- Data transfer or initialization as a CUDA kernel
- Old method of transferring data between CPU and memory (memCUDA copy)

Discuss:
- Explain the concepts of each method and how it is implemented
- Compare (a) the execution time of the kernel as well as (b) the memory transfer time
(taking into consideration page faults, overhead time if itâ€™s a separate transfer time, or
part of the kernel transfer time already).
